  My nerd hero is Elon Musk for how he has pushed forward the technology industry. He is the CEO of Tesla Motors, SpaceX, and a chairman of SolarCity. SpaceX has pushed into explored space with unexplored techniques and Tesla is going to change the way we impact the environment.

  Classically pouted as having unreasonable technological demands of his employees he has undeniably had an impact on the technological world. I would also like to shout out Tim Berners Lee (not Al Gore).
